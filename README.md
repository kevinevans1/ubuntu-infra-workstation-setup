## Brief
As I continue my open source journey , I though it best to share my setup scripts for configuring your Ubuntu workstation for Azure infrastructure development. These script's will install dependencies for getting you up and running with deploying IaC into Azure using Terraform,Bicep,Powershell and Azure CLI.

The config_install.sh script contains the following package managers:

### Package managers

- Homebrew (https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-on-Linux)
- Flatpak (https://flatpak.org/)

### Gnome extensions

- Caffine (https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/517/caffeine/)
- Compwiz (https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3210/compiz-windows-effect/)
- Vitals  (https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1460/vitals/)
- Dash to Dock Cosmic (https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/5004/dash-to-dock-for-cosmic/)



## Feedback
Please report any bugs via issues here on GitHub and I will look to fix, or try and fix yourself and submit a pull request :)

Thanks
